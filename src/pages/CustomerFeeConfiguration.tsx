                convenience fees and miscellaneous fees to card and ACH
                transactions processed through the virtual terminal. Each

                Your service provider must enable the customer fee feature, and
                you need administrative permissions to configure fees. Some
                processors or card brands restrict or prohibit surcharging,
                so be sure to check your merchant agreement.

                On the fee configuration page you can create a new fee by
                choosing its type, giving it a label and setting a fixed or
                percentage amount. You can decide whether the fee applies to
                card payments, ACH payments or both. Toggle the fee on or off
                as needed and save your changes.

                  A surcharge is a percentage or flat fee applied to credit
                  card transactions to recoup interchange costs. Surcharges
                  may be restricted by state or card brand rules and usually
                  cannot exceed 4% of the transaction amount.

                  Convenience fees are charged for providing an alternative

                  They must be a flat amount and cannot vary based on the

                  Miscellaneous fees can be used to pass on specific costs,

                  You may set a flat amount or percentage, subject to
                  processor approval.
