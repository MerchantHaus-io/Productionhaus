              Welcome to the developer guides. This section contains
              integration documentation for building custom payment
              solutions. Whether you're embedding a hosted checkout page or
              implementing complex tokenization flows, you'll find concise
              summaries and best practices here. Each guide is styled
              consistently with our merchant portal and includes anchor links
              for easy navigation.

                Our developer guides are organised by integration method.
                Begin with the Integration Overview to learn about APIs
                versus SDKs and discover which approach best suits your
                use case. Then explore individual guides for detailed
                implementation notes and security considerations.

                between Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and
                Software Development Kits (SDKs) and lists the available
                integration options. From there, follow the links to
                specific guides such as Payment API, Three Step Redirect,
                Collect.js and more.
