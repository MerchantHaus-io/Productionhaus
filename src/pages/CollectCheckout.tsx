              Collect Checkout offers a fully hosted checkout page that
              you can embed into most web‑based payment flows. It lives
              entirely on the gateway’s servers, which means no payment
              data ever touches your environment.

                Collect Checkout is designed for merchants who want a
                streamlined integration without handling sensitive data.
                Instead of building your own checkout form, you point
                customers to a hosted payment page that is customised via
                configuration settings. This page collects all payment
                and billing information and then redirects shoppers back
                to your site with the result.

                To use Collect Checkout you typically follow these steps:
              </p>
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
                <li>
                  Generate a checkout session on your server by calling
                  the gateway’s API with the order details. The
                  response includes a unique checkout URL.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Redirect or embed the customer to this URL. The
                  hosted page collects payment and billing details and
                  displays confirmation screens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once the payment completes, the gateway redirects
                  back to your return URL with the transaction status
                  so you can fulfil the order.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </section>

            {/* Benefits */}
            <section id="benefits" className="space-y-4 mb-12">

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Because Collect Checkout runs entirely on the gateway, no
                payment data flows through your infrastructure.
                This makes PCI compliance easier and reduces your
                development effort. You still retain control over the
                look and feel via configuration and can provide a
                seamless redirect or modal experience for your
                customers.
