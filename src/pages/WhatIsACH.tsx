              The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is an electronic network for
              transferring funds between bank accounts in the United States.
              ACH payments are commonly used for payroll, bill payments and
              recurring subscriptions.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                ACH transfers are batch‑processed, low‑cost and suitable for
                recurring or large payments. Funds are typically available
                within one to two business days. Unlike card payments, ACH
                debits can be returned for reasons such as insufficient funds
                or incorrect account information.

                ACH debits can be returned with an R‑code explaining the
                reason. Common returns include insufficient funds (R01),
                account closed (R02) and invalid account number (R03). You
                can obtain the return code and description from your
                processor’s reporting tools.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                If an entry is returned, do not retry without correcting the
                underlying issue. Excessive returns can result in fines and
                loss of ACH processing privileges.

                documentation for two years. Certain transactions, such as
                international or telemarketing debits, have additional
                requirements.
