 * sending transactions to the platform.

                Direct Connect allows terminal device makers to pre‑equip
                their hardware to communicate with our platform. The
                integration examples and documentation provided by the
                gateway help you embed the necessary protocols into your
                device firmware.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                The Gateway Emulator is designed for merchants who
                already use another gateway (such as Authorize.Net)
                and want to switch to our platform without rewriting
                their software. It allows you to post transactions to a
                proxy URL that forwards the data to the platform while
                emulating the original gateway’s response format.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                According to independent guidance, the Gateway Emulator
                works by changing your existing shopping cart’s
                transaction post URL to the emulator endpoint.
                Your cart must support Authorize.Net AIM or SIM in order
                to make this switch. Once configured, transactions are
                forwarded to our gateway while your current software
                continues to operate as if it were communicating with
                Authorize.Net. This allows merchants to keep pre‑written
                software in place while leveraging the features of our
                platform.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Direct Connect integrations require an EMV Level 3
                processor certification for each device and processor
                combination you support. This is
                usually negotiated via a commercial agreement.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                For the Gateway Emulator, verify that your shopping
                cart supports Authorize.Net’s AIM or SIM method and
                thoroughly test transactions after updating the post
                URL. Note that certain advanced features of your
                previous gateway may not be available when using the
                emulator.
