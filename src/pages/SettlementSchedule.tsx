                Terminal capture means that authorisations are stored on the
                gateway until you settle. You can control when settlement
                occurs by setting a cut‑off time. Host capture processors
                settle automatically at the processor’s discretion and cannot
                be configured.

                <strong>Terminal capture</strong> stores authorisations on the
                gateway and requires you to specify when to send them for
                settlement. <strong>Host capture</strong> routes
                authorisations directly to the processor, which batches and
                settles them automatically.

                Settlement time affects funding but not transaction approval.
                If you process high volumes, consider scheduling settlement
                outside of business hours to avoid delays in your daily
                operations. Note that same‑day funding options may have
                different cut‑off requirements.
