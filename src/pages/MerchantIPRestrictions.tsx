              Restricting access by IP address provides an extra layer of
              protection against unauthorized logins. Only users connecting
              from allowed addresses or recognised devices will be able to log
              in.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                When IP restrictions are enabled, only addresses listed in
                your allow list or devices you have explicitly recognised can
                access the portal. This reduces the risk of account
                compromise.

                You can optionally allow devices outside your IP list to log

                browser, you’ll receive a verification email. Once you
                approve the device, future logins from that device are
                permitted even if the IP address is not on the list.

                IP restrictions apply to all users on the account. Make sure

                you can’t access your account due to IP restrictions, your
                provider can temporarily disable them to restore access.
