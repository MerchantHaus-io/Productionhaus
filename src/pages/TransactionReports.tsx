              This guide introduces the transaction reporting feature and shows
              you how to run the most common reports. Reporting tools allow you
              to search transactions across a wide range of fields and drill into
              the data by date, processor, card type, user and more. Use the
              sections below to learn the basics and then explore deeper as
              needed.

              Overview
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The reporting feature lets merchants search transactions using a
              variety of parameters. Reports can be generated via two forms:
              <strong className="font-semibold"> Transaction Snapshot</strong>, which
              provides a high‑level summary across multiple criteria, and
              <strong className="font-semibold"> Search Transactions</strong>, which
              allows precise searches on fields such as last name, email or
              transaction ID. The Snapshot form offers eight
              grouping options, while the search form contains up to 15 standard
              fields plus any merchant‑defined fields on your account.
            </p>

            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              To access transaction reports, a user must have the “Access
              Transaction Reports” permission. The account must also have at least
              one active processor. If you wish to view transactions processed
              by other users on the account, you’ll need the “Access Other
              Users’ Transactions” permission.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Navigate to the reporting tools via the left‑hand menu of the
              portal or from the home page by selecting <em>Reporting →
              Transactions</em>.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The <strong>Transaction Snapshot</strong> form provides an at‑a‑glance
              view of your activity. You can group results by settlement batch,
              card/payment type, processor, user, source or date range.
              Each snapshot shows columns for pending authorisations, charges,
              refunds, returns/chargebacks, voids, declines and totals.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The <strong>Search Transactions</strong> form supports more
              granular queries. Standard fields include customer name, email,
              transaction ID and date. Up to twenty merchant‑defined fields may
              also be available.
