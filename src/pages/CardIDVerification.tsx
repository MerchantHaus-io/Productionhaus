              The card verification value (CVV) is a three‑ or four‑digit code
              printed on cards. Requiring it for every transaction reduces
              fraudulent use of stolen card numbers.

                CVV is used to confirm that the purchaser has the physical card
                in hand. The code is not stored on the magnetic stripe or chip,
                so it cannot be captured during a data breach.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                During payment, the cardholder enters their CVV. The processor
                requests verification from the issuer, who returns a result
                code. You can decide which codes should cause a decline and
                which should be allowed.

                all cards. If you have multiple processors, configure each one
                separately.
