              AVS compares the billing information provided by a customer
              against the records held by their card issuer. By enabling AVS
              checks you can automatically reject transactions with mismatched
              addresses, helping to prevent fraudulent purchases.

                When a transaction is submitted, the address verification
                service validates the street number and postcode (or ZIP code)
                with the card issuer. The issuer responds with a code
                indicating whether the address matches their records.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                AVS returns result codes such as <em>Y</em> (match), <em>N</em>
                (no match) and others. The gateway uses these codes to
                determine whether to accept or reject the transaction. You can
                configure your own rules for domestic and international cards
                based on these codes.

                To enable AVS, navigate to the AVS settings page and toggle
                the service on. You’ll see separate rule sets for domestic and
                international transactions. Choose which response codes should
                cause a decline. If you work with multiple processors, you can
                create different rule sets per processor.

                Beyond the basic match/no match rules, AVS allows you to block
                specific conditions such as partial matches or unsupported
                services. You can also require AVS only on the first
                transaction for recurring payments.
