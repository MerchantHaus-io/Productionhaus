              To improve security, accounts without two‑factor authentication
              are required to update their password every 90 days. A
              countdown banner in the portal reminds you when it’s time to
              change your password.

                When the 90‑day policy is active, a progress bar displays the
                number of days remaining until your password expires. You can
                change your password at any time, and the counter resets to
                90 days.

                Password expiration only applies to users who have not
                enabled two‑factor authentication. Each time you log in, the
                portal will check when your password was last updated. If
                it’s been more than 90 days, you’ll be prompted to create a
                new password before proceeding.

                Enabling two‑factor authentication removes the password
                expiration requirement. Once 2FA is active, you won’t need to
                change your password every 90 days, and you will gain access
                to additional security features such as device recognition
                and bypassing password prompts for a set period.
