              The Payment Device SDKs for Windows and Linux enable
              developers to integrate software with a variety of
              payment terminals. They abstract the complexities of
              interacting with devices and include a downloadable
              emulator with sample code and server binaries.

                These SDKs provide libraries and tools to communicate with
                EMV‑certified payment terminals on Windows or Linux
                platforms. They allow your application to initiate and
                manage transactions without handling low‑level device
                protocols.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                These SDKs are ideal for independent software vendors
                building point‑of‑sale systems, kiosks or unattended
                payment solutions on desktop platforms. The emulation
                environment enables developers to test without owning
                hardware and to validate integrations before deploying
                to physical devices.
