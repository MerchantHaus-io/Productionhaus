                With Customer Present Cloud, you don’t need to deploy
                drivers or SDKs on merchant PCs. Instead, a web
                application communicates with payment devices through a
                secure cloud service. Because it runs in a standard
                browser, it’s operating‑system agnostic and can be
                launched from any compatible device.
